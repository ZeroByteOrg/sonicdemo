It is my belief that this project utilizes these assets in a transformative
fashion for demonstrative purposes and thus constitutes fair use. (see below)

All art assets for this demo were created by Sega, and used without permission.
Using them in this project is understood to be "fair use" - however:

ALL ASSETS REMAIN THE SOLE PROPERTY OF SEGA.
NO LICENSE IS HEREBY GRANTED FOR THEIR USE IN ANY OTHER FORM.

Specifically, the purpose of the program is to demonstrate the graphical and
sound capabilities of the Commander X16 computer using well-known imagery for
instant recognition by the user. There will be no further development of this
program into any form of playable game, as that is not the purpose here.
